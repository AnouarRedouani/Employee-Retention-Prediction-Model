# Employee Retention Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI model designed to reduce hiring and training costs by predicting which employees are most likely to leave the company. By identifying potential turnover risks early, the company can implement targeted retention strategies, improve employee satisfaction, and ultimately reduce the costs associated with hiring and training new employees.

## Objectives
- **Predict Employee Turnover:** Build a predictive model that can accurately forecast which employees are at risk of leaving the company.
- **Data Analysis:** Use historical employee data to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover, such as job satisfaction, compensation, work-life balance, and career growth opportunities.
- **Retention Strategies:** Develop actionable insights and strategies for the HR department to retain valuable employees based on the model's predictions.
- **Cost Reduction:** By preventing employee turnover, the company can significantly lower the costs associated with recruitment, onboarding, and training.

## Key Features
- **Data-Driven Approach:** Leverage employee data, including demographic information, performance metrics, and feedback, to train the model.
- **Machine Learning:** Implement various machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions about employee turnover.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Create a user-friendly interface for the HR department to visualize the model's predictions and track key performance indicators related to employee retention.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly update the model with new data to improve its accuracy and adapt to changing workforce dynamics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data processing, model development, and implementation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for building and training the predictive model.
- **Data Visualization Tools:** Like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for creating the interactive dashboard.
- **Version Control:** GitHub for managing and tracking changes in the project.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Enhanced Employee Retention:** Improved ability to retain employees by proactively addressing the factors leading to turnover.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduction in hiring and training costs by decreasing employee turnover rates.
- **Informed HR Decisions:** Provide the HR department with data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making regarding employee retention.
